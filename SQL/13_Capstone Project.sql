/*Capstone Project

--Sales & inventory data for a fictitious chain of toy stores in Mexico called Maven Toys, including information 
--about products, stores, daily sales transactions, and current inventory levels at each location.

--Write queries to answer the following questions:

1. Which product categories drive the biggest profits? Is this the same across store locations?

2. How much money is tied up in inventory at the toy stores? How long will it last?

3. Are sales being lost with out-of-stock products at certain locations?

Good luck.

--Sales Impact Due to Stockouts:
--Answer: Sales are lost at locations where the stock levels are (zero or) insufficient to meet demand, particularly for highly 
		  sought-after products. This means that the supply at these locations cannot keep up with customer demand.
